## Keylogger Tool

The keylogger tool allows you to track keystrokes on a machine. It has been packaged as a `.exe` file for easy use and also available as a Python script.

### How to Use the Keylogger

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pranav-ti/cybersecurity-tools.git
   cd cybersecurity-tools
    ```

2. **Install the required libraries**
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r cybersecurity-tools/keylogger/requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Keylogger Script**

    ```bash
    python3 cybersecurity-tools/keylogger/keylogger.py
    ```

Alternatively, you can use the pre-built .exe file to run the keylogger.
